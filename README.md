<h2>Definition of Computer Graphics:</h2>
<p>It is the use of computers to create and manipulate pictures on a display device. It comprises of software techniques to create, store, modify, represents pictures.</p>
<h2>Why computer graphics used?</h2>
<p>Suppose a shoe manufacturing company want to show the sale of shoes for five years. For this vast amount of information is to store. So a lot of time and memory will be needed. This method will be tough to understand by a common man. In this situation graphics is a better alternative. Graphics tools are charts and graphs. Using graphs, data can be represented in pictorial form. A picture can be understood easily just with a single look.<br>

Interactive computer graphics work using the concept of two-way communication between computer users. The computer will receive signals from the input device, and the picture is modified accordingly. Picture will be changed quickly when we apply command.</p>

<h3>Some points to know before start.</h3>
<h2>Concept of Pixel</h2>
<p>The full form of the pixel is "Picture Element." It is also known as "PEL." Pixel is the smallest element of an image on a computer display, whether they are LCD or CRT monitors. A screen is made up of a matrix of thousands or millions of pixels. A pixel is represented with a dot or a square on a computer screen.</p>
